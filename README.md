# Snake

A basic browser snake game. The user uses WASD / arrow keys to navigate a snake around the board. Points are scored by collecting food, which also increases the length of the snake. The game continues until the snake crashes into the wall or itself.

The speed of the snake and board dimensions are pre-fixed for ideal gameplay experience and cannot be changed by the user. However, these values are hard-coded and can be changed by modifying the project. When the board dimensions are changed, it will accurately scale the board to fit in the given space.

This game was built on pure HTML, CSS, and JS. It takes advantage of modern CSS features like flexboxes and viewport sizing to effectively align and size all components.
